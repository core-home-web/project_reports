# End of Year Review GitHub Dashboard - Cursor Rules

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Storage**: Cloudflare KV
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Development Principles

### Critical Rules
1. **NEVER GUESS**: If uncertain about implementation details, requirements, or design decisions - ASK the user before proceeding
2. **Break up long tasks**: Any task taking more than 30 minutes should be split into smaller sub-tasks
3. **Iterate and verify**: Complete each task fully before moving to the next; verify it works
4. **UI/UX first**: Clean, accessible, intuitive interfaces that follow established design patterns
5. **Clean code**: Modular, well-commented, consistent naming conventions
6. **Scalable**: Design for growth (more repos, more data, more users)
7. **Reusable**: Components and functions should be generic enough for other use cases
8. **Test before pushing**: After every new implementation, run a test to ensure the console doesn't report errors. If there are no errors, push to the git repo
9. **Test after pushing**: Wait 1 minute after a GitHub push to test the website in the browser and crawl the site to make sure everything works as intended

### UI/UX Design Guidelines
- **User-centered design**: Keep end users at the center of every decision
- **Ease of use**: Organization, consistency, and intuitive navigation
- **Visual hierarchy**: Guide users through content with clear structure
- **Accessibility**: Ensure clickable actions are highly noticeable and accessible for color-blind users
- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile screens first, then scale up
- **Empathy**: Understand user motivations and provide what they need in the simplest way

## Reference Documentation

### UI/UX Design Resources (Consult Before Designing)
- Webflow UX Design Process: https://webflow.com/blog/ux-design-process
- Figma UI Design Principles: https://www.figma.com/resource-library/ui-design-principles/
- Figma Mobile Website Design: https://www.figma.com/resource-library/mobile-website-design/
- Figma Mobile-First Design: https://www.figma.com/resource-library/mobile-first-design/

### Technical Documentation (Consult Before Implementing)
- GitHub REST API: https://docs.github.com/en
- Cloudflare Developers: https://developers.cloudflare.com

### When to Use References
- **If unsure about GitHub API**: Consult GitHub docs before implementing
- **If unsure about Cloudflare Workers/KV**: Consult Cloudflare docs before implementing
- **If unsure about UI/UX decisions**: Review Figma and Webflow resources before designing

## Code Style

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `eoyr-filters.js`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `fetchWeekData()`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)
- **CSS Classes**: kebab-case (e.g., `.week-row-item`)

### Code Organization
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Group related functions together

### File Structure
- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Separate concerns: HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), JS (behavior)
- Use existing CSS classes from `wanderlostgalaxy.webflow.css` where possible
- Create new styles in `eoyr.css` for dashboard-specific needs

## Project-Specific Notes

### GitHub Integration
- Track repos from `core-home-web` organization
- Use GitHub REST API v3
- Support date range filtering
- Group commits by ISO week (Monday-Sunday)

### Cloudflare Worker
- Cache responses in KV with 1 hour TTL
- Handle webhook events for cache invalidation
- Support filtering by date range and repo

### Frontend
- Reuse layout pattern from `stories.html`
- Implement filtering, sorting, and date range selection
- Make all interactive elements highly visible and accessible
- Support URL parameters for sharing/bookmarking filtered views
