# Add Website Iframe Previews to Sidebar Panels

## Overview

Enhance the existing sidebar project card panels by adding live iframe previews of each website. The iframes will be landscape/rectangular, positioned above the existing title and description, and maintain the current hover effects and navigation behavior.

## Implementation

### 1. Add Iframes to Project Cards

**File**: [`index.html`](index.html)

For each of the 4 website project cards (lines ~199-229):

- **Hydragear Bottle** (line 199): Add iframe for `https://hydragearbottle.com`
- **Spice St Market** (line 207): Add iframe for `https://spicestmarket.com`
- **People of Spice** (line 215): Add iframe for `https://peopleofspice.com`
- **Outlaw Spice** (line 223): Add iframe for `https://outlawspice.com`

Each iframe should be added inside the `.project-card-content` div, BEFORE the title and description.

Structure will be:

```html
<div class="project-card-content">
  <iframe src="https://website.com" class="project-preview"></iframe>
  <div class="navbar-right-text project-title">Title</div>
  <div class="project-description">Description</div>
</div>
```

### 2. Style the Iframes

**File**: [`index.html`](index.html)

Add CSS (in the existing `<style>` section or inline) for `.project-preview`:

- Landscape aspect ratio (16:9 or 16:10)
- Width: 100% of card
- Height: proportional (e.g., ~200-250px)
- Border radius to match card style
- Pointer-events: none (prevents interaction, clicking card opens site)
- Border: subtle border matching theme
- Margin bottom: spacing before title

### 3. Adjust Card Layout

**File**: [`index.html`](index.html)

Ensure `.project-card-content` is set up to display:

- Flex column layout (if not already)
- Proper spacing between iframe, title, and description
- May need to adjust card height to accommodate iframe

### 4. Maintain Existing Behavior

No changes needed - cards remain clickable via the `<a>` tag, hover effects continue working via `.scale-on-hover`, and navigation highlighting stays the same.

### 5. Handle CORS/Embedding Restrictions

Some websites may block iframe embedding via X-Frame-Options. If any site doesn't display:

- Add fallback styling (show a placeholder or gradient background)
- Or use screenshot/static image as alternative

## Technical Notes

- Leave "Core Render Portal" panel unchanged (user only mentioned the 4 main websites)
- Iframes with `pointer-events: none` allow clicking anywhere on card to open full site
- Existing `.scale-on-hover` and `.project-card` styles should work with new layout
- Test responsive behavior on mobile to ensure iframes scale properly
